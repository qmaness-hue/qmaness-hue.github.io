title: Hardware V2.0

## Overview
If a "Hardware Version 2.0" were to be created. These would be possible changes.

## Changes
Some changes that would be made would be toto better utilize both sides of the PCB, as well as make labels more clear.
A larger PCB board would allow for a more straightforward, 'cleaner,' look for the PCB. This would make it much easier to populate the board, solder it, and indicate to others how the system works electronically. This goes along with the change to make the labels more clear. Having clearer labels, such as a difference between the different resistors beyond their ratings as given by the schematic, would make it a more comprehensible design for anyone who might see it. A (better) alternative to making the board larger--as well as just an overall good idea--would be to better utilize both sides of the board. When I first made the board, I overlooked the fact that the bottom copper side of the board can also include vias. Although this made it easier to picture, as only one side was really needed to show the whole thing, it was much more inefficient and less straightforward than it could have been. Better utilizing both sides would make many of the complex and jumbled-looking vias on my PCB more succinct and easier to understand.
