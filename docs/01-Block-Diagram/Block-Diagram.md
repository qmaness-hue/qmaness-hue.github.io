## Overview
The purpose of this block diagram is to get a basic visual representation of what my subsystem for the ClapSense will look like. It indicates the mechanism for creating a system that automatically shuts the ClapSense off when there's already enough light present. It also shows how many connections will be made as well as where they will be on the board.
