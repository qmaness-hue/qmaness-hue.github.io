## Overview
The purpose of this block diagram is to get a visual representation of what my part for the team assignment might look like. It indicates the mechanism for creating a frequency filter for both sound frequency and decibel level (allbeit in a simplified depiction). It also shows how many connections will be done as well as approximately where they will be on the board.

To get some initial formatting help, one can view ["here"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/Appendix/basic-markdown-examples/) some basic techniques.
