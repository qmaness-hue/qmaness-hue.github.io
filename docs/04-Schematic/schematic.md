## Overview

This schematic is designed to support a system that utilizes a light sensor to determine whether or not the clap light being on is necessary or not. In a case where there's enough light in front of the sensor (placed away from the clap light), then the clap light will automatically be shut off to save power. Seeing as this system might not work with every individuals case--or they may not want this system in place--the subsystem also has an external switch to turn it on or off.
