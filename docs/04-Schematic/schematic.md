## Overview

This schematic is designed to support a system which takes an input audio frequency and decibel level and filters each separately so that only the frequency and decibel of a clap are output. Therefore, if the input sound was a clap, there will be values for both decibel level and frequency. These outputs will be sent to the other team members' subsystems, which will then turn on or stay off (based on if the outputs indicate a clap).
