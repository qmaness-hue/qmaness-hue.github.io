## Overview

Below are the front and back of the PCB design for the light sensor subsystem of the ClapSense clap light. [*Figure 1*](SubsystemPCBdesign.front.pdf) is the PCB, [*Figure 2*](SubsystemPCBdesign.front.pdf) is the front copper plate of the PCB, and [*Figure 3*](SubsystemPCBdesign.back.pdf) is the back copper plate of the PCB. Below the figures are resources such as the PDF versions of the figures, as well as the zip file for the subsystem created within Kicad.
