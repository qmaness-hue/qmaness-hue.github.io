## Overview

Below are the main PCB, front copper plate, and the back plate of the PCB design for the light sensor subsystem of the ClapSense clap light. [*Figure 1*](LightSensorPCB.all.pdf) is the PCB, [*Figure 2*](LightSensorPCB.front.pdf) is the front copper plate of the PCB, and [*Figure 3*](LightSensorPCB.pdf) is the back copper plate of the PCB. Below the figures are resources such as the PDF versions of the figures, as well as the zip files for the Gerber files of the PCB and the overall subsystem.
