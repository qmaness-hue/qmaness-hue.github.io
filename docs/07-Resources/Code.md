## Microcontroller Code

The microcontroller code is an integral piece of the subsystem design. The code for the subsystem was created and implemented using MPLab. Without the code, there would be no interaction between the different subsystems, and the only way to tell its functionality would be through manually measuring the system with an oscillator or multimeter (for example). Below is the zip file containing the MPLab code used for the light sensor subsystem.

The code files for the microcontroller are available [*here*](LightSensorSubsystemPIC.zip).
