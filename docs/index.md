## Introduction

* The purpose of this datasheet is to show the individual work and specifications from group member Quinn Maness towards ClapSense.

### Project Summary

* ClapSense is a project whos creators aim to create an inclusive, modern, reliable, and inexpensive new clap light that both has immense customization and a simple process for doing so.
* This datasheet gives an overview of the filtering subsystem. An essential step towards the culmination of our four members' ideas as given in the [team report.](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-204.github.io/)


### My Contribution

* This datasheet gives an in depth visual and written explanation behind everything within the filtering subsystem of ClapSense--all of which is my contribution.
* If you wish to see my individual (and more in-depth) block diagram, navigate to the [Block Diagram.](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/)
* If you wish to see the specific components that the filtering subsystem consists of, as well as possible alternative components and the reasoning behind the chosen components, navigate to the [Component Selection](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/) section.
* If you wish to review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.
* If you wish to look at the detailed schematic, as well as further explanation behind the subsystem's functions, look to the [Schematic](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/) section.
* If you wish to see the power budget for the subsystem, as well as the organized specifications of included major components, look to the [Power Budget.](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/)
* For any supporting information that might not have been included in the above sections, look to the [Appendix.](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/Appendix/)
