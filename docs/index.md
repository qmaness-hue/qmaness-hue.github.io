## Introduction

* The purpose of this datasheet is to show the individual work and specifications from group member Quinn Maness towards ClapSense.

### Project Summary

* ClapSense is a project whos creators aim to create an inclusive, modern, reliable, and inexpensive new clap light that both has immense customization and a simple process for doing so.
* This datasheet gives an overview of the light-sensor subsystem. An essential piece of our four members' overall creation as given in the [team report.](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-204.github.io/)


### My Contribution

* This datasheet gives an in depth visual and written explanation behind everything within the light-sensor subsystem of ClapSense--all of which is my contribution.
* If you wish to see my individual (and more in-depth) block diagram, navigate to the ["Block Diagram."](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/)
* If you wish to see the specific components that the light-sensor subsystem consists of, as well as possible alternative components and the reasoning behind the chosen components, navigate to the ["Component Selection"](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/) section.
* If you wish to review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.
* If you wish to look at the detailed schematic, as well as further explanation behind the subsystem's functions, look to the ["Schematic"](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/) section.
* If you wish to see the power budget for the subsystem, as well as the organized specifications of included major components, look to the ["Power Budget".](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/)
* For the PCB of the subsystem, including the Kicad files and layers of the PCB, refer to the ["PCB"](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/06-PCB-Design/IndividualPCB/) section.
* As for extra resources, such as the code that went into my individual PIC microcontroller, look to the ["Resources"](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/07-Resources/Code/) section.
* The section, ["Hardware V2.0"](https://github.com/qmaness-hue/qmaness-hue.github.io/blob/main/docs/08-Hardware-V2.0/Hardware.md) includes any possible improvements that could have been made in hindsight.
* For any supporting information that might not have been included in the above sections, look to the [Appendix.](https://qmaness-hue.github.io/Appendix/)
